# AI-Writing Pattern Catalog for Academic Papers

This catalog lists the habits that make a draft read as machine-written, and says which ones are safe to repair in a research paper. Most de-slopping advice was written for blogs and marketing copy. Applied unchanged to a paper it deletes hedges, flips Methods into active voice, strips "Moreover" from legitimate argument chains and breaks the reader's trust. The "Safe for papers?" column exists to prevent that.

## How to read the catalog

"Safe for papers?" has three values:

- **yes**: repair on sight; the pattern has no legitimate use in a paper.
- **with care**: the pattern is also ordinary scholarly practice; repair only when the condition in the Rule column holds.
- **no**: do not touch; the pattern is a paper convention or a template matter.

Rows are candidates, not verdicts. Read the sentence in context, check the condition in the Rule column, and prefer leaving a sentence alone over a doubtful edit. One sighting of a weak tell means nothing; several tells in one passage justify action. Structure rows (group S) carry more signal than vocabulary rows (group V), so spend effort in that order. `humanize.md` gives the procedure; this file is the lookup table.

Ids (C1, V2, S5, ...) are stable so that review reports and the humanize log can cite them. Each group's letter is its id prefix.

## C. Content and claims

| Id | Pattern | Looks like | Repair | Safe? | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Significance inflation | "marks a pivotal moment", "a paradigm shift", "a testament to" | State the concrete contribution or result in plain words | yes | Keep the fact, drop the verdict on its importance. |
| C2 | Hype adjectives and novelty padding | "groundbreaking", "novel" in every sentence, "first to" without a search | Name the difference from the closest prior work | with care | "Novel" or "state-of-the-art" may appear once as a technical claim tied to a stated comparison. |
| C3 | Superficial -ing rider | ", highlighting the importance of X", ", underscoring the need for" | Delete the rider, or turn it into a sentence the evidence supports | yes | Keep the fact before the comma; keep the rider only if a result backs it. |
| C4 | Borrowed authority | "studies show", "experts argue", "it is widely accepted" with no source | Add the citation and what it found, or cut the claim | yes | Every attribution carries a key or goes; never invent the source (invariant I2). |
| C5 | Citation dumping | "[3-14]" after a generic sentence | Cite the one or two works that bear on the claim and say why | with care | Field norms differ; a survey sentence may legitimately cite many. |
| C6 | Formulaic opener | "In recent years, X has attracted considerable attention", "With the advent of" | Open on the specific gap or the problem | yes | The first sentence survives only if it names something concrete. |
| C7 | Generic positive closer | "holds great promise", "paves the way for", "opens new avenues" | Keep the fact, drop the verdict; if nothing concrete is left, cut the sentence | yes | A closing sentence earns its place by stating a fact or a boundary already in the paper; a humanize pass never adds one (I7). |
| C8 | Content-free challenges section | A "Challenges and Outlook" block of generic obstacles and vague optimism | Replace with specific limitations and named follow-ups | with care | The section is required by many venues; the tell is emptiness, not the heading. |
| C9 | Over-claiming verb | "prove", "demonstrate", "establish" on correlational or small-n evidence | Report it and route to `evidence` or `hypothesis`, which match verb strength to the evidence ladder (invariant I4) | no (route) | Never change a claim's strength while humanizing, up or down; the wording changes only after the claim's status does. |
| C10 | Vague hedging | "somewhat", "fairly", "relatively" with no comparison | Give the number or the comparison class, or delete | yes | A hedge that carries no information is padding; an evidence-tied hedge is content (see the protections). |
| C11 | Empty intensifier | "extensive experiments", "numerous studies", "significantly" with no test | Give counts, datasets, effect sizes, test names | yes | Keep "significantly" only where a test backs it. |
| C12 | Unnamed concrete world | "a popular model", "a large benchmark", "standard settings" | Name the model, dataset, hyperparameters | with care | Only if the facts are in the source; blind-review anonymity may require the vague form on purpose. |
| C13 | Content-free evaluation | "This is an important finding." standing alone; "In other words..." restating the line above | Delete, or replace with the mechanism or consequence | with care | Discussion must interpret; cut only a sentence that adds no mechanism, number or implication. |
| C14 | Both-sidesism without a verdict | "on the one hand... on the other" where the paper owes a conclusion | Commit to the reading the evidence favors | with care | Related Work may present both sides; Results and Discussion should commit. |
| C15 | Arguing with no one | "To be clear, we are not claiming...", "One might think..." answering nobody | Cut it, or state the real claim | with care | Pre-empting a real reviewer objection is good practice; cut only invented ones. |
| C16 | Contribution-list cliche | "We make three contributions: a novel framework, extensive experiments, and insights" | Restate each contribution as a claim with its quantity | yes | Each bullet names a result, a number or an artifact. |
| C17 | Fabricated or garbled reference | A DOI that resolves to another paper, a plausible title nobody published | Run `scripts/verify_citations.py`; fix or mark `[VERIFY]` | yes | Mandatory check outside the humanize pass; never repair a citation by guessing. |
| C18 | Audit or defensive voice | "this was verified rather than assumed", "the pipeline was confirmed to", sentences arguing with an imagined reviewer, repository chatter | State the design fact once where the reader needs it; move process detail to Methods or an appendix | with care | Keep reproducibility facts and mandated statistics reporting; delete governance language and self-congratulation. |

## V. Vocabulary

| Id | Pattern | Looks like | Repair | Safe? | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | General AI-vocabulary cluster | delve, tapestry, realm, intricate, meticulous, pivotal, underscore, showcase, foster, bolster, vibrant, multifaceted, holistic | Use the plain verb or noun, or cut | with care | Act on three or more in a paragraph; one word proves nothing, and single words age out within a year. |
| V2 | Academic excess vocabulary | elucidate, delineate, unveil, noteworthy, seamless, invaluable, "shed new light", "warrants further investigation", "a deeper understanding of" | Say what was found or done | yes | Mined from abstracts, so it is the right list here; never ban ordinary words such as across, within, findings or potential. |
| V3 | Copula avoidance | "serves as", "stands as", "represents", "functions as", "boasts" | Use is, are, has | yes | Plain "is" is normal scholarly prose; repair on sight. |
| V4 | Synonym cycling | participants, then subjects, then individuals, then the cohort, all for one group | Pick one term and repeat it | yes | One term per concept; repeating a defined term is correct and is the highest-value fix in a paper. |
| V5 | False range | "from X to Y" joining things that are not on one scale | List the items, or name the real span | yes | Keep real ranges such as "from 8 to 64 layers". |
| V6 | Filler phrase | "It is worth noting that", "in order to", "due to the fact that", "at the present time" | Delete or shorten | yes | Delete the frame and keep the sentence it introduced. |
| V7 | Business jargon | lean into, deep dive, game-changer, synergy, actionable | Plain verb | yes | Rare in papers; "scalable" and "ecosystem" can be technical, so read context. |
| V8 | Ornamental adverb | markedly, strikingly, remarkably, truly, genuinely | Delete, or give the number the adverb stands in for | with care | Keep functional adverbs: independently, randomly, significantly-with-a-test. |
| V9 | Vague connection | "associated with", "linked to", "tied to" used for a specific relation | Pick the verb that names the relation (predicts, increases, mediates) | with care | In observational work "associated with" is the honest word; never upgrade it to a causal verb. |
| V10 | Field-specific word tics | "Beyond,", "via", non-locative "where", "yield", "Given" repeated | Vary only where the same word recurs within a few lines | with care | These are conventions in many subfields; check how published papers in your venue write. |

## S. Structure and staging

Structure first: this group carries the strongest signal and is the first thing a rewrite should touch. Rows S1 to S7 are document shape; S8 to S16 are sentence-level staging.

| Id | Pattern | Looks like | Repair | Safe? | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Uniform sentence rhythm | Every sentence 15 to 25 words; low coefficient of variation | Merge supporting sentences, trim others, vary openings | with care | Never merge two claim sentences, never create staccato; Methods may be uniform by nature. |
| S2 | Uniform paragraph or section length | Every subsection is three paragraphs of four sentences | Let the material set the length | with care | Do not pad to vary; Methods detail is not padding. |
| S3 | Connective paragraph openers | More than a third of paragraphs open with Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally | Open on the claim; keep a connective that names a real relation | with care | Preserve however, thus, in contrast when they mark a real logical turn; cap runs of identical openers at two. |
| S4 | Preview and restate | Intro lists the sections; each section's first sentence echoes its heading | Say the thing once | with care | The one roadmap sentence in the Introduction is a venue convention and stays; remove the echoes inside sections. |
| S5 | Closing loop | Conclusion repeats the Introduction in the same words with no new fact | Cut the echo; if no new element remains, report the gap to the author and route to `write` | with care | Conclusions restate by design; a humanize pass never adds a limitation, number or next step (W30, I7). |
| S6 | Over-explaining | A second or third sentence after the evidence restating what it meant | Cut the repeats; move speculation about mechanism to Discussion | with care | Keep the one sentence per paragraph that ties the numbers to the claim they support (W74); a Results paragraph without it is a list of numbers. Never delete the only sentence stating the mechanism. |
| S7 | Forced triad | Three adjectives, three examples, three clauses by reflex | Keep the strongest one or two | with care | Keep real triads, such as three measured metrics. |
| S8 | Negative parallelism | "not only X but also Y", "it is not X, it is Y", "This does not mean X. It means Y." | State the positive claim | with care | Keep when both halves carry a fact (method A against method B); cut when the negative half is a claim nobody made. |
| S9 | One-line closer | "That is the real win.", "Let that sink in.", dramatic fragments | Delete | yes | Cut when it restates the paragraph above. |
| S10 | Run-up | "Let us dive in", "Here is the thing", "In this section we will explore" | Delete the run-up | yes | Keep the one roadmap sentence in the Introduction; delete all other throat-clearing. |
| S11 | Rhetorical question setup | "Why does this matter? Because..." | State the answer | yes | Interrogative openers that frame the analytic question are legitimate in Introduction and Discussion; do not add them either. |
| S12 | Stacked hedge | "may potentially suggest the possibility that" | Collapse to one hedge: "may suggest" | with care | Never remove the last hedge; never turn "suggests" into "shows". |
| S13 | Clause-stacked sentence | More than 30 words with three or more subordinate clauses; piled noun compounds | Split at the logical seam; expand compounds on first use | with care | Split without hiding which condition belongs to which comparison. |
| S14 | Repeated sentence openers | Five sentences in a row opening "We then...", "The model..." | Reorder or merge only where the sequence is not a procedure | with care | Procedural steps in Methods may repeat; leave them. |
| S15 | Register shift between sections | Generic Methods and specific Results, or the reverse | Audit per section; raise the vague one to the other's level of detail | yes | A pronounced shift is a stronger tell than any phrase; fix it with true detail, never with flourish. |
| S16 | Question-format headings | "Why Does X Fail?" | Use a descriptive heading | with care | Some venues like them; follow the template and the author profile. |
| S17 | List standing in for an argument | Findings, reasons or steps as bullet fragments with no sentence saying how they connect | Rewrite as prose that states the links (because, unless, which rules out); keep a list only for parallel, separable items | with care | Contribution lists, datasets and hyperparameters may stay lists, with one sentence saying what they add up to (W75). |
| S18 | Private vocabulary | Letter codes or nicknames for conditions ("arm B", "C2", "the canary run") that the reader must decode in every sentence | Report it and route to `write` or `revise`: renaming is a terminology edit | no (route) | Replace with plain descriptions and record them in the glossary table (W73); never rename inside a humanize pass, because the verification script reads each removed code as a dropped fact. |
| S19 | Number dump | A paragraph of values in "X reads a against b" form with no sentence saying what they show | Report it and route to `write`: the values move to a table and the prose keeps the one to three that carry the claim | no (route) | Moving numbers is a content edit; a humanize rewrite must keep every number (W74, I7). |

## P. Punctuation and format

| Id | Pattern | Looks like | Repair | Safe? | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Em-dash overuse | A dash as the universal connector, several per paragraph | Replace with the punctuation that names the relation: comma, colon, parentheses, full stop | with care | Capped, never banned by rule: none in the abstract, at most one per paragraph elsewhere; range dashes are exempt; follow the venue and the author profile. |
| P2 | Bold-label lists and bare-noun bullets | "**Robustness**: ..." rows in a LaTeX paper | Convert to prose, or keep a real contribution list | with care | Papers seldom use them; a contribution list may. |
| P3 | Decorative headings, emoji, rules, forced Title Case | Emoji in a heading, a horizontal rule between sections | Remove | no | The template controls heading case; fix only stray Markdown that leaked into LaTeX. |
| P4 | Mixed quote marks | Curly and straight quotes after pasting | Normalise to what the source format uses | no | LaTeX sets quotes; aim for consistency only, and never alter quoted material. |
| P5 | Hyphenation drift | "high-quality" after the noun, inconsistent compound modifiers | Follow the house style | with care | Standard hyphenation rules decide; do not change terms of art. |
| P6 | Colon reveal and exclamation | "The answer is:", "The key takeaway:", exclamation marks | Write the sentence | yes | Colons that introduce a real list or definition stay. |
| P7 | Unicode obfuscation | Homoglyphs, zero-width characters, odd spaces | Remove and normalise | yes | Invisible characters break search and signal evasion; clean them whatever their origin. |

## L. Leftovers and hygiene

| Id | Pattern | Looks like | Repair | Safe? | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Chatbot residue | "I hope this helps", "Certainly!", "Would you like me to..." | Delete | yes | Never belongs in a paper. |
| L2 | Cutoff or availability disclaimer | "As of my last update", "specific details are limited" | Delete, then supply the fact or mark `[VERIFY]` | yes | Do not fill the gap from memory. |
| L3 | Markup and reference leaks | `oaicite`, `contentReference`, `utm_source=chatgpt.com`, `[Your Name]`, stray Markdown in LaTeX | Delete and re-source the claim | yes | Mandatory; a leaked citation token often marks an unverified claim. |
| L4 | Writing about the document | "This section was generated to...", "compiled from the above" | Delete | yes | The paper never describes how the text was produced; tool use goes in the disclosure line. |
| L5 | Reasoning-chain residue | "First, let me consider...", "Wait, actually" | Delete | yes | Remove, then re-read the paragraph for gaps. |

## Not tells in a paper: do not act

Several popular lists flag the items below. A paper needs them, and flagging them produces false repairs.

| Item | Why it stays |
|---|---|
| Formal, academic register | Formality is not an AI marker; lists that name it as one are wrong for this genre. |
| Evidence-tied hedging ("may", "suggests", "preliminary") | The venue and the evidence require it; the tell is generic hedging with no evidence attached (C10, S12). |
| Passive voice in Methods | A convention where the agent is irrelevant; keep it. |
| "The results show / suggest" | Standard scientific phrasing, even though some lists call it false agency; leave it. |
| "We" | Normal in CS, ML and many sciences; keep it. |
| Standard connectives followed by data | However, thus, in contrast mark real logic; see S3. |
| Perfect grammar and plain prose | Not evidence of anything. |
| Semicolons and colons in moderation | Ordinary punctuation. |
| Statements that look unsourced | They may be the author's own result; check, do not assume. |
| "Perplexity injection": swapping predictable words for surprising ones | It lowers precision and the strongest detectors do not reward it; precision beats surprise. |
| Defined-term repetition | Correct practice (V4). |
| Readability grade and "reading level" flags | A research paper reads at a high grade by design; ignore the number. |

## Keep what carries a person

A rewrite that removes these makes the text cleaner and worse, and it also scores worse on structure. Leave them:

- an oddly specific detail, such as a particular seed, a run date, or a number that is strange because it is true;
- an unresolved tension stated honestly ("we do not know why this happens");
- a hedge the author chose on purpose, and its position;
- a short sentence that states a claim outright;
- a first-person choice the author can defend ("we chose X because Y");
- a limitation that stings;
- phrasing that is unusual but correct, especially from a non-native writer: raise it as a question to the author, never as a defect.

## When not to act

Act on nothing in these cases:

- Quoted text, titles, proper names, and passages that discuss a phrase rather than use it.
- Math, LaTeX commands, labels, references, code, and tables.
- Text written before late 2022: the author wrote it, and many of these habits are older than chatbots.
- A passage with a single weak tell and nothing else.
- A section whose rhythm and specifics already look like the author's own: say in one line that nothing needs doing and return it unchanged.
- Any edit that would add, drop or alter a number, a citation, a hedge that carries meaning, or the strength of a claim. Those are not style edits; report them and send them to the `evidence`, `hypothesis` or `write` modes.

## Maintenance notes

Vocabulary lists in group V are the most perishable part of this file: a word can fall out of use within a year, and newer models suppress some habits on their own. Treat the structure and staging rows as durable and the vocabulary rows as examples of a cluster, not as a vocabulary to ban. When a venue or field disagrees with a "safe" verdict here, follow the venue and record the exception in the author profile.
