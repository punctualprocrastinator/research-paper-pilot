## How to use this list

Every rule in `style-rules.md`, `write.md` and `evidence.md` was re-expressed from one or more of these sources, or from the agent-skill packs listed in ATTRIBUTION.md at the repository root (not shipped with the skill when installed alone). Read a source when a rule needs its full argument, when the user wants the original, or before adding a rule. The "where it lives" column points to the part of this skill that carries the idea. Links resolved when checked in October 2026, except where a row says otherwise; pages move, so search by title if one fails.

## Venue policies (check the live page before relying on these)

| Venue document | Link | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| NeurIPS paper checklist guidelines | https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist | The checklist items the submit mode asks for |
| NeurIPS 2026 reviewer guidelines | https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2026/ReviewerGuidelines | What reviewers are told to look for; feed to the blind reviewer lens |
| NeurIPS 2026 Evaluations and Datasets guidelines | https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2026/EvaluationsDatasetsReviewerGuidelines | For benchmark or dataset papers |
| NeurIPS 2025 LLM policy | https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM | Disclosure of LLM use; the humanize mode's disclosure line follows it |
| NeurIPS 2026 position track, AI-generated papers | https://blog.neurips.cc/2026/06/02/ai-generated-papers-in-the-neurips-2026-position-paper-track/ | Venue stance on AI authorship |
| Conference AI-agent policy FAQ (secondary source) | https://aicards.uni-goettingen.de/ai-agent-conference/ | Cross-venue summary; verify against each venue's own page |

The rule from `submit.md` applies: fetch the official call for papers, record the URL and the date checked, and never guess this year's limits from last year's.

## Repackagings of the same advice

These restate the guides above and add nothing the skill does not already carry: the `ml-paper-writing` skill on skills.sh (smithery), `ai-paper-writing` (jumyungpark), the claudecodehq playbook, and `research-paper-writing` in oh-my-skills. Useful as checklists, not as new sources.

## Coverage notes

Read in full when building the rules: Nanda, Farquhar, Steinhardt (blog), Lipton (blog), Lipton and Steinhardt (paper, via the HTML version), Perez, Langley, Peyton Jones (slides), Parikh, Carlini, Karpathy. Read via abstract or excerpt only: Gopen and Swan, Schulman, Freeman. Not read: Foerster, Widom, Black, Hamming, Film Study, the body of Research Debt, Easterbrook's page itself. Not covered by this skill's rules: pure theory papers, and systems- or vision-specific norms beyond what Freeman quotes.
